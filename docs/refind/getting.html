<hr />

<p>This page is part of the documentation for the rEFInd boot manager. If a Web search has brought you here, you may want to start at the <a href="index.html">main page.</a></p>

<hr />

<p><b>Note:</b> I consider rEFInd to be <i>beta-quality software!</i> I'm discovering bugs (old and new) and fixing them every few days. That said, rEFInd is a usable program in its current form on many systems. If you have problems, feel free to drop me a line.</p>

<h2>Getting rEFInd from Sourceforge</h2>

<p>You can find the rEFInd source code and binary packages at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/refind/">its SourceForge page.</a> Note that rEFInd is OS-independent&mdash;it runs before the OS, so you can download the same binary package for any OS (although some OS-specific packages are also available, for ease of installation). You can obtain rEFInd in several different forms:</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-bin-0.13.3.1.zip/download">A
    binary zip file</a></b>&mdash;Download this file if you want to install
    rEFInd and/or its filesystem drivers on an <i>x</i>86, <i>x</i>86-64, or
    ARM64 computer and have no need to test rEFInd first by booting it on an
    optical disc or USB flash drive. This zip file package includes
    <i>x</i>86 (aka IA32), <i>x</i>86-64 (aka <i>x</i>64, AMD64, or EM64T),
    and ARM64 (aka AARCH64 or AA64) versions of rEFInd. Which you install
    depends on your architecture, as described on the <a
    href="installing.html">Installing and Uninstalling rEFInd</a> page. Some
    users of Arch
    Linux have reported problems booting some specific Arch Linux kernels
    with rEFInd and some other tools. For them, a <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-bin-gnuefi-0.13.3.1.zip/download">variant
    package</a> exists in which the <i>x</i>86-64 binary was compiled with
    GNU-EFI rather than the usual TianoCore EDK2. This change helps some
    users with this problem.</li>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-0.13.3.1-1.x86_64.rpm/download">A
    binary RPM file</a></b>&mdash;If you use an RPM-based <i>x</i>86-64
    Linux system such as Fedora or openSUSE, you can install the binary RPM
    package rather than use the binary zip file. (I don't provide
    equivalent 32-bit [<i>x</i>86] or ARM64 packages.) This package runs the
    <tt>refind-install</tt> script (described on the <a
    href="installing.html">Installing and Uninstalling rEFInd</a> page) as
    part of the installation process. The <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-0.13.3.1-1.src.rpm/download">source
    RPM file</a> might or might not build on your system as-is; it relies
    on assumptions about the locations of the GNU-EFI development
    files.</li>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind_0.13.3.1-1_amd64.deb/download">A
    binary Debian package</a></b>&mdash;If you use an <i>x</i>86-64 version
    of Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, or another Debian-based distribution, you can
    install from this package, which was converted from the binary RPM
    package using <tt>alien</tt>. Note that an <a href="#ppa">Ubuntu
    PPA</a> is available, which may install more smoothly and will cause
    rEFInd to automatically update with other packages.</li>

<p class="sidebar"><b>Note:</b> At the moment, neither the bootable CD-R image file nor the bootable USB flash drive image file supports booting with Secure Boot active. The x86-64 version of the <a href="http://en.altlinux.org/Rescue">ALT Linux Rescue disc</a> uses a Secure Boot-enabled rEFInd, though, so you may find that useful in some situations.</p>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-cd-0.13.3.1.zip/download">A
    CD-R image file</a></b>&mdash;This download contains the same files as
    the binary zip file, but you can burn it to a CD-R to test rEFInd
    (and its filesystem drivers) without installing it first. (It boots on
    UEFI PCs, but fails on some older Macs.) If you like it, you can then
    copy the files from the CD-R to your hard disk. The files are named in
    such a way that the disc should boot on either 64-bit (<i>x</i>86-64)
    or 32-bit (<i>x</i>86) EFI computers. I've included an open source EFI
    shell program on this disc that's not included in the binary zip file,
    so that you can access an EFI shell from a bootable disc even if you
    don't have an EFI shell available from your regular hard disk. This can
    be an extremely valuable diagnostic tool if you know how to use an EFI
    shell.</li>

<p class="sidebar"><b>Tip:</b> If you want to make your own bootable USB
flash drive, download the binary zip file or CD-R image file, prepare a USB
flash drive with a FAT32 partition, and then use the
<tt>refind-install</tt> program's <tt>--usedefault</tt> option, and perhaps
the <tt>--alldrivers</tt> option, as in <tt class="userinput">bash
refind-install --usedefault /dev/sdd1 --alldrivers</tt> to install to the
first partition on <tt>/dev/sdd</tt>. This procedure should work even on a
BIOS-booted computer.</p>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-flashdrive-0.13.3.1.zip/download">A
    USB flash drive image file</a></b>&mdash;Although you can create your
    own rEFInd USB flash drive using the binary <tt>.zip</tt> file and its
    <tt>refind-install</tt> script, you may find it easier to download this
    version and copy it to your USB drive with <tt>dd</tt> or some other
    low-level disk copying utility.</li>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-src-0.13.3.1.tar.gz/download">A
    source code tarball</a></b>&mdash;This is useful if you want to compile
    the software locally. Note that I use Linux with the <a
    href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tianocore/">TianoCore EFI
    Development Kit 2 (EDK2)</a> to build my binary packages (above),
    although the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-efi">GNU-EFI</a> development
    tools are also supported, and are used in building the Ubuntu PPA.</li>

<li><b><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/refind/code/ci/master/tree/">Source code via
    git</a></b>&mdash;If you want to peruse the source code in your Web
    browser or get the very latest version (including pre-release bug fixes
    and updates), you can use the Sourceforge git repository. This access
    method is most useful to programmers, or at least to those who are
    familiar with programming tools. If you need to ask "what's git?", this
    is probably not the best way for you to obtain rEFInd.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're using a platform other than <i>x</i>86, <i>x</i>86-64, or ARM64, you can give rEFInd a try; however, you'll need to build it from source code yourself or track down a binary from another source. (Perhaps by the time you read this it will be included in Linux distributions built for unusual CPUs.)</p>

<p>To extract the files from the zip file images I've provided, you'll need a tool such as <tt>unzip</tt>, which is included with Linux and Mac OS X. Numerous Windows utilities also support this format, such as <a href="http://www.pkware.com/software/pkzip/">PKZIP</a> and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip.</a> The source files come in tarball format, for which a tool such as the Unix/Linux <tt>tar</tt> utility is appropriate.</p>

<h2>Getting rEFInd from Your OS's Repositories</h2>

<p>I know of a small number of pre-packaged versions of rEFInd, either in official OS repositories or in ancillary repositories:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Debian</b>&mdash;Debian added rEFInd 0.10.3 to its "sid" (unstable")
    repository in June of 2016. As of early 2020, rEFInd is now part of the
    "stable" Debian release. You can download and install it as a separate
    package <a
    href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/refind">here.</a>
    Be aware that Debian's package is not signed with a Secure Boot key,
    although if the <tt>sbsigntool</tt> package is installed, the
    installation scripts will generate and use their own Secure Boot keys
    and sign the binary with them.</li>

<li><b>Ubuntu</b>&mdash;Two Ubuntu-specific methods of installing rEFInd in
    this distribution exist:

    <ul>

    <a name="ubuntu">
    <li>Ubuntu 17.04 ("Zesty Zapus") and later include rEFInd. Note that,
	like the Debian package, this one is not signed for use with Secure
	Boot, but if your system includes the <tt>sbsigntool</tt> package,
	the installer will generate a local key for this purpose. If you
	want a more recent version, you can use my PPA or install my Debian
	package.</li></a>

    <a name="ppa">
    <li>I've created a <a
	href="https://launchpad.net/~rodsmith/+archive/refind">rEFInd
	PPA</a> for Ubuntu. To use it, open a Terminal window and type the following commands:</a>

<pre class="listing">$ <b>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:rodsmith/refind</b>
$ <b>sudo apt update</b>
$ <b>sudo apt install refind</b></pre>

	You'll be asked whether to install
	rEFInd to the ESP when you first install it. Thereafter, the rEFInd
	version will update along with your other software. This package is
	built with GNU-EFI and is not signed with a Secure Boot key;
	however, the install script should sign the binary with a
	locally-generated key if it detects that your system uses Secure
	Boot. Thus, if you've previously installed one of my binaries on a
	Secure Boot system and added its key as a MOK, you'll have to add
	your local key when you reboot.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li><b>Arch Linux</b>&mdash;You can obtain rEFInd from the Arch
    repositories, in both a stable version (the <tt>refind</tt> package
    installable via <tt>pacman</tt>) and an experimental release built from
    rEFInd's git repository in the Arch User Repository (AUR), under the
    name <tt>refind-efi-git</tt>. The git release is likely to include
    pre-release bug fixes and new features, but those features may be
    poorly tested or undocumented.</li>

<li><b>ALT Linux</b>&mdash;This RPM-based distribution uses
    rEFInd by default on EFI-based computers. If I understand correctly,
    ALT's optical disc installer boots with a combination of rEFInd and
    ELILO. The distribution provides an RPM of rEFInd; see <a
    href="http://packages.altlinux.org/en/Sisyphus/srpms/refind">this
    page</a> for details.</li>

<li><b>Gentoo Linux</b>&mdash;An official ebuild of rEFInd is available; see
    <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-boot/refind">here</a>
    for details and <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Refind">here</a>
    for Gentoo's official rEFInd documentation.</a> Because Gentoo packages
    are compiled locally, there is no version that's pre-signed with Secure
    Boot keys; but as with any rEFInd binary, you can sign it yourself, and
    the installer script should do so automatically if <tt>sbsign</tt> is
    available.</li>

<li><b>Slackware</b>&mdash;As far as I know, an official rEFInd package is
    not available as part of Slackware; however, a <a
    href="https://www.slackbuilds.org/result/?search=refind&sv=">Slackware
    package from SlackBuilds</a> is available.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/">Fat
    Dog</a></b>&mdash;This variant of Puppy Linux uses a combination of
    rEFInd and GRUB 2 to boot its installation medium in EFI mode and
    provides a rEFInd package in its repository set.</li>

<li><b>The <a href="http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nix Packages
    collection</a></b>&mdash;This site creates packages for a number of
    OSes using its own packaging system.</li>

</ul>

<p>Please keep in mind that OS package repositories lag behind the official rEFInd releases. This time lag can be trivial or significant, depending on the distribution's update policy and release schedule. If you have a problem with rEFInd, please check the latest official release version and, if it's newer than what you've installed from a package repository, update it.</p>

<p>If you hear of rEFInd being included in another OS's official package set, feel free to <a href="mailto:rodsmith@rodsbooks.com">drop me a line.</a></p>
