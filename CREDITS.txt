Although I (Roderick W. Smith) am releasing rEFInd in its current form, the
program is not the work of a single person. Others have contributed to the
program, both in its original version (rEFIt) and by providing features
I've incorporated into the current version. Specifically:

Program (C source code and script) files:
-----------------------------------------

* Christoph Pfisterer was the original author of rEFIt. See its Web page,
  http://refit.sourceforge.net, for this version of the program. Christoph
  has therefore contributed more to rEFInd than anybody else, myself
  included; my changes are comparatively small additions to the original
  rEFIt base.

* The Debian project has made a version of rEFIt available that
  incorporates a number of patches, all attributed to Julien BLACHE
  (jblache@debian.org), to enable it to build properly on a Linux system.
  It was this version of rEFIt that I used as a starting point for creating
  rEFInd. See http://packages.debian.org/sid/refit for this version of the
  program.

* The filesystem drivers released with version 0.4.0 rely on a filesystem
  wrapper created by Christoph Phisterer. They then passed through Oracle's
  VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org) and the Clover boot loader
  project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/). The
  filesystem-specific code comes from various sources, including Apple,
  the Linux kernel, and Christoph Pfisterer.

* Assorted support code is borrowed from the TianoCore EDK2
  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tianocore/), which is the reference
  implementation for EFI.

* Dave Vasilevsky (dave@vasilevsky.ca) contributed the disk-ejection
  code.

* John Bressler (jrb1327@gmail.com) contributed the code to boot BIOS-based
  OSes on UEFI-based PCs.

* CJ Vaughter contributed the code for support of touch displays and mice,
  with some improvements to the former by Tom Briden.

* The code for editing boot options (cursor_left(), cursor_right(), and
  line_edit() in screen.c) is taken from gummiboot
  (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gummiboot).

* Stefan Agner (stefan@agner.ch) turned the original ext2fs/ext3fs driver
  into one that can read ext4fs.

* Samuel Liao ported the GRUB 2 Btrfs and NTFS code into EFI drivers and
  contributed them to this project, along with several miscellaneous
  improvements.

* Martin Whitaker (other@martin-whitaker.me.uk) added 64-bit support
  to the ext4fs driver.

* Emerson Barcelos (emerson_freitas@yahoo.com.br) wrote the code for
  enabling Intel VMX support (the enable_and_lock_vmx token in
  refind.conf).

* Rohan Sehgal (rohan.sehgal.su@gmail.com) wrote code to help rEFInd
  detect network boot options and launch them, with the help of the
  external ipxe.efi and ipxe_discover.efi programs.

* Matthew J. Garrett (mjg@redhat.com) wrote the shim boot loader upon which
  rEFInd relies for its Secure Boot functionality. I took a few shim
  functions to help out on the rEFInd side, too; see the mok/mok.c source
  code file.

* James Bottomley (James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com) wrote the
  Linux Foundation's PreBootloader, which is an alternative to shim. I've
  found that much of its code is also useful in implementing Secure Boot
  functionality in rEFInd. Most of the files in the mok subdirectory are
  based on Bottomley's PreBootloader code.

* The PNG support, in the files libeg/lodepng.c and libeg/lodepng.h, is a
  slightly modified version of LodePNG (http://lodev.org/lodepng/) by Lode
  Vandevenne. (The libeg/lodepng_xtra.c file provides some necessary
  ancillary and interface functions written by me.)

* Pavel Penev contributed the code to enable encrypting rEFInd's locally
  generated signing keys in refind-install.

* The RefindPkg.dec and RefindPkg.dsc files, used to enable compiling
  rEFInd in the traditional TianoCore way, come from
  https://github.com/snarez/refind-edk2.

Icons and graphics:
-------------------

* Most icons are derived from the AwOken icon set, version 2.5, by
  Alessandro Roncone (aka alecive); see
  http://alecive.deviantart.com/art/AwOken-163570862. Many of these icons
  have been scaled or altered in color from their original forms.

* The Debian icon is based on the SVG available from
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Debian-OpenLogo.svg. I modified
  it to fit the general style set by the AwOken icons.

* The Elementary OS icon is based on the SVG available from
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elementary_logo.svg. I modified
  it to fit the general style set by the AwOken icons.

* Erik Kemperman provided the original (pre-0.9.3) rEFInd icon, which is a
  combination of the common refresh/reload icon and the search/find icon.
  For version 0.9.3, I created a new icon from Erik's basic design concept,
  but to match the AwOken flat-with-drop-shadow style.

* Additional icons were created by me.
