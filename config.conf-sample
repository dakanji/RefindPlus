##               ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION ITEMS                 ##
##          New Functionality Provided by RefindPlus            ##
##--------------------------------------------------------------##
#
#
# Supply APFS filesystem capability. By default, RefindPlus is set up to jump-start
# Mac OS APFS filesystem drivers, apfs.efi, which are available in system folders of
# Mac OS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later. The drivers are loaded to match each specific
# Mac OS version. This ensures that any changes made to APFS drivers for each specific
# Mac OS version are accommodated, compared to using one driver no matter what specific
# Mac OS version is being loaded. This default is deactivated whenever this token is set.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# APFS filesystem capability is supplied (if required) when commented out
#
#decline_apfsload

# Suppress verbose APFS loading text output. By default, RefindPlus is configured to always
# suppress verbose text output from APFS drivers loaded via its "SupplyAPFS" functionality.
# This feature only acts on apfs drivers loaded via the default "SupplyAPFS" functionality.
# This feature may impact other text output however, and should be disabled by activating
# this option if such negative effects are observed. This option only applies to Mac OS.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# Verbose APFS text is allowed (if genereated) when commented out
#
#decline_apfsmute

# Apple has partially enforced the use of the "PreBoot" Loader stored in the "PreBoot" partitions
# of APFS volumes by requiring this to run the Mac Boot Loader, starting with Mac OS v11.x, when
# SIP is enabled. Attempts to run such Mac OS Boot Loaders directly when SIP is enabled result
# in kernel panics. The default setting in RefindPlus is to always map APFS volumes to their
# respective "PreBoot" partitions, which will be used to boot such Mac OS instances and the
# associated "PreBoot" partitions will be hidden from view. This arrangement also permits
# booting into FileVault encrypted APFS volumes with their volume labels (not PreBoot).
# When this option is enabled however, the RefindPlus "SyncAPFS" feature is disabled.
#
# NB: Maintain the default naming pattern for APFS data volumes, "VolName - Data",
# to improve the reliability of "SyncAPFS" distinguishing between APFS volumes.
# Also, avoid the use of special characters in Mac OS volume names and limit
# names to alphanumeric characters. Dashes, underscores and/or spaces can
# be used in combination with alphanumeric characters without issue.
#
# APFS partition synchronisation is allowed when commented out
#
#decline_apfssync

# Allow scans of multiple ESPs. When this option is active, RefindPlus
# will make other ESPs, separate from that containing RefindPlus,
# available to be scanned for kernels and loaders.
#
# Scans of other ESPs are allowed when commented out
#
#decline_espfilter

# Supply NVME driver. By default, RefindPlus is set up to always load
# a built in version of the NvmExpressDxe driver which provides NVMe
# support when unavailable. This is disabled when this token is on.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# NVMe support is provided (if required) when commented out
#
#decline_nvmeload

# Allow/Prevent saving UEFI Windows "Secure Boot" certificates to the NVRAM on Macs.
# By default, RefindPlus will prevent UEFI Windows Secure Boot from writing security
# certificates to the NVRAM on Apple Macs as this can result in an inability to boot.
# This setting is only activated when Apple Firmware is detected on UEFI Windows boot.
#
# UEFI Windows security certificate writes to Mac NVRAM are allowed when commented out
#
#decline_nvramprotect

# When GOP drivers, which are UEFI 2.x drivers, are implemented in compliance with
# UEFI 2.x requirements, they do not work on legacy devices as the specifications
# mandate that on installation, compliant GOP drivers should confirm devices are
# UEFI 2.x compliant and to fail if they are not. Hence, compliant GOP drivers
# do not activate on Classic MacPros for instance, as these are not actually
# UEFI 2.x but EFI 1.x devices to which Apple has added a chunk of, but not
# all of, the UEFI 2.x capabilities. RefindPlus is configred by default to
# temporarily partially amend a device's EFI Revision to v2.x and then try
# reinstalling a copy of the GPU's Option ROM whenever it detects that GOP
# is not available. The changes are reverted afterwards and permit running
# modern GPUs on some legacy units when they would otherwise fail to work.
# This program default configuration is deactivated by setting this token.
#
# GOP drivers are not reloaded when commented out
#
#decline_reloadgop

# Help with "hidden_tags" setup. RefindPlus always makes the "hidden_tags" tool available
# by default (even when the tool is not specified in the "showtools" list). This is done
# to ensure that items hidden (always possible) can also be unhidden (only possible if
# the "hidden_tags" tool is available). When this option is enabled, this "help" with
# setup will be deactivated and the ability to unhide items will be solely based on
# whether the "hidden_tags" tool has been explicitly added to the "showtools" list.
#
# The "hidden_tags" tool is always available when commented out
#
#decline_tagshelp

# RefindPlus defaults to scanning volumes for .VolumeIcon image icons and if
# found, these may be used as display icons for some volumes. However, most
# RefindPlus setups do not include these files and most of those that may
# do, typically Apple Macs, do not require the files as their icons in
# Refindplus. Hence, scanning for the files typically just slows the
# RefindPlus boot process down. When active, this speeds booting
# RefindPlus up by skipping scanning volumes for these files.
#
# Always scans for ".VolumeIcon" image icons when commented out
#
#ignore_hidden_icons

# While RefindPlus does default to scanning volumes for ".VolumeIcon" image icons,
# any such files found are only used as last ditch display icons when all other
# display icon options fail. When this option is set, RefindPlus will instead
# first try to display ".VolumeIcon" image files before attempting to load
# other image icon files. This permits flexibility in theming loaders by
# positioning such files for loading by RefindPlus. Note however, that
# the "ignore_hidden_icons" option takes priority over this setting.
# NB: ".VolumeIcon" icon files can be in any supported format ...
# ICNS (*.icns), BMP (*.bmp), PNG (*.png), or JPG (*.jpg/jpeg).
#
# Does not prioritise ".VolumeIcon" images when commented out
#
#prefer_hidden_icons

# The SimpleText protocol on the ConsoleOut handle is usually used for
# text output. On Macs and some other firmware, this is complicated by
# the ConsoleControl protocol which determines whether to output text,
# graphics, or both, and this often results in an inability to display
# text, or use tools needing text output (such as EFI Shell). A custom
# text renderer is added on top of GOP by this option as a workaround.
# Note that this option is forced on whenever text output is required,
# such as when running EFI Shell or, whenever RefindPlus is changed to
# text mode as part of its operations (mainly to show error messages).
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not use a custom text renderer)
#
#text_renderer

# RefindPlus defaults to storing the name of the last booted loader in
# the "PreviousBoot" variable in the NVRAM under the RefindPlus GUID. This
# provides a default option to be selected on the main screen when RefindPlus
# is loaded. This can however increase wear and tear on the NVRAM and disabling
# the "use_nvram" token writes variables to the filesystem instead, limiting this.
# On some setups however, such as when the "default_selection" token is set, such
# writes are not required to start with. When the "ignore_previous_boot" setting
# is active, RefindPlus will not store the "PreviousBoot" variable anywhere.
#
# Always saves the "PreviousBoot" variable when commented out
#
#ignore_previous_boot

# Some computers may have multiple GOP instances:
#     - One installed on the ConsoleOut handle
#     - Others installed on GPU handles.
# GOP on the ConsoleOut Handle is what everything uses and is provided by
# the system firmware and others provided by GPU firmware. The firmware
# should typically forward calls from the ConsoleOut Handle GOP to the
# others transparently. On such models, it only works in this way with
# GPUs with system firmware support. This option replaces GOP on the
# ConsoleOut Handle with one from a GPU Handle on such models when
# running capable GPUs but without full system firmware support.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not provide ConsoleOut GOP)
#
#provide_console_gop

# Adds a UGA Protocol to GOP, when absent, to allow RefindPlus graphics
# display when using modern GPUs on units with only EFIBoot capability.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not add UGA to GOP)
#
#uga_pass_through

# Use a built-in GOP renderer which may provide enhanced performance
# and fix rendering issues on certain specific GPU models including
# the Radeon VII and some versions of the Radeon 5700 XT. However,
# this should only be used when there is an obvious benefit as it
# may result in glitches in the pre-boot configuration screen or
# slow scrolling response on booting into the operating system.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not use the built-in GOP)
#
#direct_gop_renderer

# Proceed automatically when notices are shown on-screen instead
# of having to press a key to continue. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will pause for nine seconds when on-screen notices
# are shown and then proceed as if a key had been pressed.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not proceed automatically)
#
#continue_on_warning

# Force "TRIM" on non-Apple SSDs. "TRIM", which may improve SSD health,
# is inactive by default for non-Apple SSDs in Mac OS. When this option
# is active however, RefindPlus will enforce Mac OS "TRIM" for all types
# of SSDs, including non-Apple SSDs. This setting only applies to Mac OS.
# Note that the setting will create a Mac OS NVRAM entry the first time it
# is triggered and that this will stay active until explicitly cleared even
# if the setting is subsequently disabled. Also note that forcing "TRIM"
# may significantly increase boot times and that enabling "TRIM" on
# non-Apple SSDs may affect the integrity of data on such SSDs.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not force "TRIM" on non-Apple SSDs)
#
#force_trim

# Disable Mac OS compatibility check when booting. Macs check whether the
# current Mac OS version is supported on the machine when booting and halts
# if not. When this option is active, RefindPlus will set a "-no_compat_check"
# boot argument which disables this check and allows boot to proceed on otherwise
# unsupported Macs. This setting only applies to Mac OS. Note that this setting will
# create a Mac OS boot argument the first time it is triggered and this will remain
# active until explicitly cleared, even if this setting is subsequently disabled.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Allows Mac OS compatibility checks)
#
#disable_compat_check

# Disable Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI) checks. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will set the "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1" boot argument which along with
# System Integrity Protection (SIP), restricts application access to OS entitlements.
# This setting only applies to Mac OS. Note that this setting will create a Mac OS
# boot argument the first time it is triggered and that this will remain active
# until explicitly cleared, even if this setting is subsequently disabled.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Allows AMFI checks)
#
#disable_amfi

# RefindPlus will automatically enlarge icons and text when HiDPI screens are detected.
# The detection is basic and based on detecting a minimum 1601px vertical resolution.
# This setting allows overriding the detection as follows:
#  -1    - Never scale UI elements up
#   0    - Scale UI elements up, or not, based on screen resolution
#   1    - Always scale UI elements up
#
# Scales UI elements based on screen resolution when commented out
#
#scale_ui 1

# This token allows actively enabling or disabling the System Integrity Protection (SIP)
# and Sealed System Volume (SSV) settings defined under the "csr_values" option. When this
# token is active, RefindPlus will actively set the CSR Policy as defined. This is done when
# RefindPlus is loaded but users can manually toggle the set values "ON" or "OFF" by using the
# "Toggle CSR" tool after RefindPlus is loaded.
# The following options are available:
#  -1    - Always Disable SIP (and SSV on Mac OS 11.x or later when configured in "csr_values")
#   0    - Take no Action
#   1    - Always Enable SIP (and SSV on Mac OS 11.x or later)
#
# Inactive when commented out (Takes no action on SIP and/or SSV)
#
#active_csr 1

# As of Mac OS v11.x (Big Sur), the previous default SIP/SSV settings which had all included
# the "CSR_ALLOW_APPLE_INTERNAL" bit may leave Macs not able to receive "Over The Air" (OTA)
# updates from Apple. Mac OS v11.x (and later) remove this bit on boot if detected but the
# attempted removal may fail when booting into Mac OS via non-standard path ways such as
# RefindPlus. It is also possible that Apple will remove this remediation feature once
# Mac models supporting Mac OS v10.15 (Catalina) are deemed by Apple to be obsolete.
# When this token is set, RefindPlus will remove this bit from the saved CSR bits
# when booting into Mac OS, OpenCore or Clover similar to the process undertaken
# in Mac OS v11.x and later. This setting can also be used with older versions.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Takes no action on "APPLE_INTERNAL" bit)
#
#normalise_csr

# Set arbitrary boot arguments on Mac OS. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will change the Mac OS boot arguments to the specified string.
# This setting only applies to Mac OS and accounts for any arguments injected
# by the "disable_amfi" and "disable_compat_check" settings. Note that this
# will create a Mac OS boot argument the first time it is triggered and
# that the boot argument will remain active until it is explicitly
# cleared, even if the setting is subsequently disabled.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not change boot arguments)
#
#set_boot_args "-v"

# Set the screen's background colour. RefindPlus defaults to using the
# RGB value of the first pixel (top left pixel) in the pixel array of
# the title banner image as set with the "banner" token in this file
# or an Apple LightGrey colour when that token is not set. This can
# be overridden by providing three (3) values, between 0 and 255,
# representing the desired RGB value for the background colour.
#
# Uses the default colour selection process when commented out
#
#screen_rgb 250 150 50

##           Existing Features Modified in RefindPlus           ##
##--------------------------------------------------------------##
#
#
# Launch specified loader in graphics mode. RefindPlus defaults to
# text mode and displays basic pre-launch information when launching
# any operating systems except Mac OS. Using graphics mode can provide
# a more seamless transition, but may not display any information, which
# can make it difficult to debug problems. However, using graphics mode
# may prevent crashes in some instances. Specifying an empty list will
# set RefindPlus up to boot all types of loaders in text mode.
# Valid options:
#   linux       - A Linux kernel with EFI stub loader
#   grub        - The GRUB (Legacy or 2) boot loader
#   opencore    - The OpenCore boot loader
#   clover      - The Clover boot loader
#   elilo       - The ELILO boot loader
#   windows     - Microsoft Windows
#   osx         - Mac OS
#
# Uses osx (Launches Mac OS in graphics mode) when commented out
#
#use_graphics_for osx,linux

# While using NVRAM works with most computers, this can increase wear
# and tear on the motherboard's NVRAM. In situations where the NVRAM is
# old and worn out, it may fail to work and lead to an inability to boot.
# Storing variables on disk is a viable alternative and RefindPlus can save
# its variables to a folder on the filesystem instead. However, this will not
# work if RefindPlus is on a filesystem that is read-only to the EFI, such as
# HFS+ volumes. In such cases, an attempt to write to the first ESP RefindPlus
# can identify will be made. If this attempt is not successful, the variable will
# not be saved and this fact will be logged if running the debug version. NB: This
# option only applies to RefindPlus variables such as the PreviousBoot, HiddenTags,
# HiddenTools, and HiddenLegacy variables and does not apply to any variables from
# other processes/libraries (These are always written to the motherboard's NVRAM).

#                         Requires Apple Firmware.
#  apple_recovery   - loads Apple Mac Recovery partitions, if present
#  windows_recovery - boots an OEM Windows recovery tool, if present.
#                     NB: Also refer to the "windows_recovery_files" option

#  csr_rotate       - adjusts Apple System Integrity Protection (SIP) policy.
#                     NB: Requires "csr_values" to be set.
#  install          - an option to install RefindPlus from the current location to another ESP
#  bootorder        - adjust the firmware's boot order variables
#  about            - an "About This Program" option
#  hidden_tags      - manage hidden tags
#  exit             - a tag to exit RefindPlus
#  shutdown         - shuts down the computer (a bug causes this to reboot many UEFI systems)
#  reboot           - a tag to reboot the computer normally
#  firmware         - a tag to reboot the computer into the firmware's user interface.
#                     NB: Ignored on older computers.
#  fwupdate         - a tag to update the firmware; launches the fwupx64.efi (or similar) program
#  netboot          - launch the ipxe.efi tool for network (PXE) booting
#
# The default setting is shell, memtest, gdisk, apple_recovery, windows_recovery, mok_tool, about, hidden_tags, shutdown, reboot, firmware, fwupdate

# Set the screen's display resolution. Pass this option either:
#         * One Value (corresponding to one UEFI GOP video mode)
#         * Two Values (corresponding to the X and Y resolutions)
# Note that not all resolutions are supported. On UEFI 2.x systems,
# passing an incorrect value results in a message being shown on the
# screen to that effect, along with a list of supported modes. With
# EFI 1.x systems, such as legacy Macs, setting an incorrect mode
# silently fails. On both types of systems, setting an incorrect
# resolution results in the default resolution being used.

# Timeout in seconds for the main menu screen. Setting the timeout to "0"
# disables automatic booting (i.e., no timeout). Setting it to "-1" causes
# an immediate boot to the default OS *UNLESS* a keypress is in the buffer
# when RefindPlus launches, in which case that keypress is interpreted as
# a shortcut key. If no matching shortcut is found, RefindPlus displays
# its menu with no timeout.
#
# The timeout is disabled when commented out
#
#timeout 20

# Set the logging level. When set to "0", a log file in the native RefindPlus format
# is produced in the RefindPlus home directory on the ESP, logging information about
# what RefindPlus is doing. When set to "1" or above, the logging is in the upstream
# format instead (a variant of). Higher values, up to the maximum of 4, record more
# information. NOTE: This option is only active when running DEBUG builds and the
# logging process, particularly higher levels, noticeably slows RefindPlus down.
#
# The native format is used when commented out (DEBUG builds only)
#
#log_level 2

# Set the CSR values for Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP) and
# Sealed System Volume (SSV) features that define access levels on Mac OS.
# Values are hexadecimal numbers that define which specific security features
# are enabled. Below are the codes for what the values mean. Add them up (in hex)
# to set new values. Apple's "csrutil enable" and "csrutil disable" commands usually
# set values of 10 (ON) and 77 (OFF) respectively. Note that 77 is just a default OFF
# setting and that users can go beyond this, to values such as 87F, 97F - up to FFF.
# The "csrutil authenticated-root enable" and "csrutil authenticated-root disable"
# commands, added in Mac OS v11.x (Big Sur), set values of 10 (ON) and 87F (OFF)
# respectively, when run along with the "csrutil enable / disable" commands.
#
# As of Mac OS v11.x (Big Sur), the previous default setting of "10" (ON)
# may leave Macs not able to receive "Over The Air" (OTA) updates from
# Apple with the reliable setting being enabling SIP/SSV by clearing
# the stored CSR value in the NVRAM. RefindPlus will clear the CSR
# setting when "0" is used in place of "10" for the "OFF" value.
# This setting is also valid on earlier versions of Mac OS. It
# is recommended however, to keep the default "OFF" setting
# of "10" in place, and to use the "normalise_csr" token
# instead to better achieve the same end (both values).

# modes. Mode "1024" is a special code that sets RefindPlus not to use
# text mode specifically but to instead use whatever mode was in use
# when it was launched. If an invalid mode is specified, RefindPlus
# will pause booting to display information on valid modes instead.
#
# CAUTION: On VirtualBox, and perhaps on some real computers, specifying

# Directories that should *NOT* be scanned for boot loaders. By default,

# Common keywords in stanza are:
#
#  disabled    - use alone or set to "yes" to disable this entry.
#  ostype      - OS type code to determine boot options available by
#                pressing Insert. Valid values are "MacOS", "Linux",
#                "Windows", and "XOM". Case-sensitive.
#  graphics    - set to "on" to enable graphics-mode boot (useful
#                mainly for MacOS) or "off" for text-mode boot.
#                The default setting is auto-detected from the
#                loader filename.
#  volume      - identifies the filesystem from which subsequent files
#                are loaded. The volume can be specified by filesystem
#                label, by partition label, or by partition GUID number
#                (but *NOT* yet by filesystem UUID number).
#  icon        - specifies a custom boot loader icon
#  loader      - identifies the boot loader file
#  initrd      - Specifies an initial RAM disk file
#  options     - sets options to be passed to the boot loader; use
#                quotes if more than one option should be passed or
#                if any options use characters that might be changed
#                by RefindPlus' parsing procedures (=, /, #, or tab).
#
#  add_options - As "options" above but only applicable when under a
#                "submenuentry" keyword. It adds the options to those
#                set for the main "menuentry" keyword.
#
# Note that you can use either DOS/Windows/EFI-style backslashes (\)
# or Unix-style forward slashes (/) as directory separators. Either
# way, all file references are on the ESP from which RefindPlus was
# launched. The order of tokens above optimises loading RefindPlus.
# Use of quotes around parameters causes them to be interpreted as
# one keyword, and for parsing of special characters (spaces, =, /,
# and #) to be disabled. This is useful mainly with the "options"
# keyword. Use of quotes around parameters that specify filenames is
# permissible, but you must then use backslashes instead of slashes,
# except when you must pass a forward slash to the loader, as when
# passing a root= option to a Linux kernel. RefindPlus will load
# faster if the "icon" line appears before the "loader" line.
# Similarly, the "disabled" line, when used, should be
