#
# Proceed automatically when on-screen notices
# are shown. When this option is active, RefindPlus
# will pause for nine (9) seconds when on-screen notices
# are shown, and then proceed as if a key has been pressed.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not proceed automatically)
#
#continue_on_warning

# This token allows actively enabling or disabling the System Integrity Protection (SIP) and
# Sealed System Volume (SSV) settings defined under the "csr_values" option. When this token is
# active, RefindPlus will actively set the CSR Policy as defined. This is done when RefindPlus is
# loaded but users can manually toggle the set values "ON" or "OFF" by using the "Rotate CSR" tool.
# The following options are available:
#   1    - Always Enable SIP (and SSV on MacOS 11.x or later)
#   0    - Take no Action
#  -1    - Always Disable SIP (and SSV on MacOS 11.x or later when configured in "csr_values")
#
# Inactive when commented out (Takes no action on SIP and/or SSV)
#
#csr_dynamic 1

# As of MacOS v11.x (Big Sur), the previous default SIP/SSV settings, which had all included
# the CSR_ALLOW_APPLE_INTERNAL bit, may leave Macs not able to receive "Over The Air" (OTA)
# updates from Apple. MacOS v11.x (and later) remove this bit on boot if detected but the
# attempted removal may fail when booting into MacOS via non-standard approaches such as
# RefindPlus. It is also possible that Apple will remove this remediation feature once
# Mac models supporting MacOS v10.15 (Catalina) are deemed to be obsolete by Apple.
# When this token is set, RefindPlus will remove this bit from the saved CSR bits
# when booting into MacOS, similar to the process done by MacOS v11.x and later.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Takes no action on SIP/SSV settings)
#
#csr_normalise

# The "HelpIcon" feature prefers loading default/generic loader icons which are used
# in most cases. Searches for custom icons are only executed if a generic loader icon
# is not found. This is a change from the original rEFInd implementation; which is the
# other way round (Custom icons are searched for first). This implementation can result
# in significantly faster loading speeds in the best case and should make no difference
# to loading speed in the worst case. The default/generic loader icons searched for will
# be those for the current active theme. That is, the current active theme default icons.
#
# The "HelpIcon" feature is enabled when commented out
#
#decline_help_icon

# Help with "hidden_tags" setup. RefindPlus always makes the "hidden_tags" tool available
# by default (even when the tool is not specified in the "showtools" list). This is done
# to ensure that items hidden (always possible) can also be unhidden (only possible if
# the "hidden_tags" tool is available). When this option is enabled, this "help" with
# setup will be deactivated, and the ability to unhide items will be solely based on
# whether "hidden_tags" has been explicitly defined in the "showtools" list or not.
#
# The "hidden_tags" tool is always made available when commented out
#
#decline_help_tags

# RefindPlus defaults to using complementary colours (of the title banner) for text
# to improve legibility. With custom banners however, the base colour is based on the
# colour of first pixel in the pixel array (top left pixel). This may not always embody
# all pixels in banners with multiple colours. Thus, the selected complementary colour
# for the text may not be suitable for all portions of the title banner in such cases.
# In such cases, users may wish to disable the "HelpText" feature by activating this
# token, which will make the text either white or black, based on the brightness of
# colour of the first pixel in the pixel array instead. NB: Only applies to custom
# title banners and complementary colours are always used for text when using the
# default RefindPlus title banner, as this always has a single solid colour.
#
# The "HelpText" feature is enabled when commented out
#
#decline_help_text

# RefindPlus defaults to mapping both 'F10' and '\' (forward slash) to
# the inbuilt screenshot feature. When this option is active, the F10
# key is unlinked whilst the '\' key stays linked to screenshots. It
# allows using third-party alternatives which may also map the key.
# As installed as drivers, such tools typically allow screenshots
# from external screens that the inbuilt feature does not cover.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not decouple the F10 key)
#
#decouple_key_f10

# Disable Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI) checks when booting MacOS. When this option
# is active, RefindPlus will add the "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1" boot argument which along
# with System Integrity Protection (SIP), restricts application access to OS entitlements.
# Note that this setting will create a MacOS boot argument the first time it is triggered
# and that this boot argument will remain active until it is explicitly cleared, even if
# this setting is subsequently deactivated.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not stop AMFI checks)
#
#disable_amfi

# Supply APFS filesystem capability. By default, RefindPlus is set up to jump start
# Mac OS APFS filesystem drivers, apfs.efi, which are available in system folders of
# Mac OS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later. The drivers are loaded to match each specific
# Mac OS version which ensures that any changes made to APFS drivers for each specific
# Mac OS version are accommodated, compared to using one driver no matter what specific
# Mac OS version is being loaded. This default is deactivated whenever this token is set.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# APFS filesystem capability is provided (if required) via "SupplyAPFS" when commented out
#
#disable_apfs_load

# Suppress verbose APFS loading text output. By default, RefindPlus is configured to always
# suppress verbose text output from APFS drivers loaded via its "SupplyAPFS" functionality.
# This feature only acts on apfs drivers loaded via the default "SupplyAPFS" functionality.
# This feature may impact other text output however, and should be disabled by activating
# this option if such negative effects are observed. This setting only applies to MacOS.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Verbose APFS text is suppressed (if generated) when commented out
#
#disable_apfs_mute

# Apple has partially enforced the use of the "PreBoot" Loader stored in the "PreBoot" partition
# of APFS volumes by requiring this to run the Mac Boot Loader, starting with MacOS v11.0, when
# SIP is enabled. Attempts to run such MacOS Boot Loaders directly when SIP is enabled result
# in kernel panics. The default setting in RefindPlus is to always map APFS volumes to their
# respective "PreBoot" partitions, which will be used to boot such MacOS instances and the
# associated "PreBoot" partitions will be hidden from view. This arrangement also permits
# booting into FileVault encrypted APFS volumes with their volume labels (not PreBoot).
# When this option is enabled however, the RefindPlus "SyncAPFS" feature is disabled.
#
# NB: Maintain the default naming pattern for APFS data volumes, "VolName - Data",
# to improve the reliability of "SyncAPFS" distinguishing between APFS volumes.
# Also, avoid the use of special characters in MacOS volume names and limit
# names to alphanumeric characters. Dashes, underscores and/or spaces can
# be used in combination with alphanumeric characters without issue.
#
# APFS partition synchronisation is provided (if required) when commented out
#
#disable_apfs_sync

# Disable version compatibility checks when booting MacOS. Macs check whether
# the current MacOS version is supported on the machine when booting, and halt
# if not. When this option is active, RefindPlus will add "-no_compat_check" to
# the boot arguments to disable this check, which allows MacOS boot on otherwise
# unsupported Macs. Note that this setting will create a MacOS boot argument the
# first time it is triggered and that this boot argument will remain active until
# it is explicitly cleared, even if this setting is subsequently deactivated.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not stop MacOS compatibility checks)
#
#disable_compat_check

# Disable kernel panic logging to the NVRAM. MacOS may save kernel panic logs in
# the NVRAM under certain conditions which can increase wear and tear on legacy
# Mac NVRAM. When this token is active, RefindPlus adds "nvram_paniclog=0" to
# the boot arguments which disables panic log writes to the NVRAM for writes
# to the filesystem instead. Note that this token will create a MacOS boot
# argument the first time it is triggered which will remain active until
# explicitly cleared, even if this setting is subsequently deactivated.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not stop MacOS paniclog writes to NVRAM)
#
#disable_nvram_paniclog

# Allow/Prevent saving various potentially harmful variables to the NVRAM on Macs.
# By default, RefindPlus will prevent writes of certain items by processes such as
# UEFI Windows Secure Boot (certificates) to the NVRAM on Legacy Macs as these may
# result in an overrun that will damage the BootROM (also stored on the NVRAM) and
# results in an inability to boot. This token is only activated on Apple firmware.
# NB: This feature is always disabled when RefindPlus is loaded via OpenCore.
#
# The "NvramProtect" feature is enabled when commented out
#
#disable_nvram_protect

# Replace the Apple FramebufferInfo protocol with a builtin version. By default, RefindPlus
# is configured to always install the Apple FramebufferInfo protocol when missing on Macs.
# This feature can be disabled by activating this token. It is only active when the UGA
# protocol is available and is inactive when running a GPU with the GOP protocol.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Apple FramebufferInfo protocol is provided (if required) when commented out
#
#disable_provide_fb

# When GOP drivers, which are UEFI 2.x drivers, are implemented in compliance with
# UEFI 2.x requirements, they do not work on legacy devices as the specifications
# mandate that on installation, compliant GOP drivers should confirm devices are
# UEFI 2.x compliant and to fail if they are not. Hence, compliant GOP drivers
# do not activate on classic MacPros for instance, as these are not actually
# UEFI 2.x but EFI 1.x devices to which Apple has added a chunk of, but not
# all of, the UEFI 2.x capabilities. RefindPlus is configured by default to
# amend a device's EFI Revision to v2.x, and then try to reinstall a copy
# of the GPU's Option ROM whenever it detects that GOP is not available.
# This permits running modern GPUs on some legacy units when they would
# otherwise fail to work. The change is reverted automatically once it
# is longer required to allow GPU activation except when the related
# "supply_uefi" setting is activate, as this overrides this revert.
#
# GPU Option ROMs are reinstalled (if required) when commented out
#
#disable_reload_gop

# Disable dispatching revealed DXE drivers during handle connection.
# The Controller/Handle connection exercise may sometimes reveal new
# DXE drivers on some firmware. RefindPlus versions before v0.13.2.AP
# automatically went into a loop to install such revealed DXE drivers
# until all such were installed. This installation loop *MAY* end with
# unwanted DXE drivers being installed, and also reduces loading speed
# while not being required on some types of firmware. Hence, an option
# to skip the process *MAY* be desirable on affected types of firmware.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not stop rescans for DXE drivers)
#
#disable_rescan_dxe

# Allow scans of multiple ESPs. When this option is active, RefindPlus
# will make other ESPs, separate from that containing RefindPlus,
# available to be scanned for kernels and loaders.
#
# Scans of other ESPs are prevented when commented out
#
#enable_esp_filter

# Force "TRIM" on non-Apple SSDs. TRIM, which may improve SSD health,
# is inactive by default for non-Apple SSDs in MacOS. When this option
# is active however, RefindPlus will enforce MacOS "TRIM" for all types
# of SSDs, including non-Apple SSDs. This setting only applies to MacOS.
#
# Note that the setting will create a MacOS NVRAM entry the first time it
# is triggered and that it will stay active until explicitly cleared even
# if the setting is subsequently disabled. Also, note that forcing TRIM
# on may significantly increase boot times and that enabling TRIM on
# non-Apple SSDs may affect the integrity of data on such SSDs.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not forcefully set TRIM)
#
#force_trim

# RefindPlus defaults to only scanning for ".VolumeIcon" icons on "internal"
# volumes. However, when this token is active (and the "hidden_icons_ignore"
# token is not) RefindPlus will also scan "external" volumes for these icons.
#
#hidden_icons_external

# RefindPlus defaults to scanning volumes for .VolumeIcon image icons and if
# found, these may be used as display icons for some volumes. However, most
# RefindPlus setups do not include these files and most of those that may
# do, typically Apple Macs, do not require the files as their icons in
# Refindplus. Hence, scanning for the files typically just slows the
# RefindPlus boot process down. When active, this speeds booting
# RefindPlus up by skipping scanning volumes for these files.
#
# NOTES:
# 1. This token overrides the "hidden_icons_external" and
#    the "hidden_icons_prefer" tokens when it is active.
# 2. This token is overridden by "decline_help_icon"
#
# Scans for ".VolumeIcon" icons when commented out
#
#hidden_icons_ignore

# RefindPlus always defaults to scanning volumes for .VolumeIcon image icons but
# any such files found are only used as last ditch display icons when all other
# display icon options fail. When this option is set, RefindPlus will instead
# first try to display ".VolumeIcon" image files before attempting to load
# other image icon files. This permits flexibility in theming loaders by
# positioning such files for loading by RefindPlus. Note however, that
# the "hidden_icons_ignore" option takes priority over this setting.
#
# NB: ".VolumeIcon" icon files can be in any supported format ...
# ICNS (*.icns), BMP (*.bmp), PNG (*.png), or JPG (*.jpg/jpeg).
#
# Does not prioritise ".VolumeIcon" images when commented out
#
#hidden_icons_prefer

# Offset the OS icon row position on the main screen vertically from the default.
# This token accepts positive/negative indicative flags that indicate the offset
# position of OS icons on the main RefindPlus screen. Such offsets may be useful
# when the default position of the icon row clashes with parts of custom banners.
# The indicative flags are:
#   1    - Move icon rows to the upper third of the screen
#   0    - Maintain default icon row position (mid screen)
#  -1    - Move icon rows to the lower third of the screen
#
# Defaults to zero when commented out (Does not move the icon rows)
#
#icon_row_move -1

# Finetune the OS icon row position set by the 'icon_row_move' setting. This
# token accepts positive/negative pixel values which are used to adjust the
# position of icon rows on the main RefindPlus screen. This adjustment may
# be needed to finetune the 'icon_row_move' outcome upwards or downwards.
#
# Defaults to zero when commented out (Does not adjust the icon rows)
#
#icon_row_tune 5

# When this option is activate, RefindPlus will prevent attempts to run loaders
# that are detected below a time interval after loading the screen to counteract
# spontaneous booting apparently resulting from keystroke buffers that appear to
# have been primed before RefindPlus is loaded. This appears to primarily affect
# UEFI-PC when RefindPlus is loaded done after first accessing the BIOS via keys
# such as "F12". The issue appears to be worse when external drives are present.
# A level of intervention is always active but this is typically not noticeable.
# The base threshold is increased on RefindPlus DBG build files as well as when
# external drives, including USB sticks, are detected on starting RefindPlus up.
# This token increases this derived base time threshold to a new time threshold
# below which attempts to run loaders will not be permitted in order to avoid
# RefindPlus spontaneously starting up default selections when it is loaded.
# NB: This feature does not operate on Apple firmware even when set here.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not increase base threshold interval)
#
#mitigate_primed_buffer

# When this option is activate, the RefindPlus "NvramProtect" feature will be
# extended, if set, to cover booting into Mac OS and "unknown" UEFI files.
# NB: This setting is only active, if set, on Apple firmware.
#     This feature is always disabled when RefindPlus is loaded via OpenCore.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not extend NvramProtect)
#
#nvram_protect_ex

# Allow/Prevent saving NVRAM variables based on an allowable variable size limit.
# NVRAM variables larger than the specified limit will be discard. This setting
# should only be used on Legacy Apple Macs where the built in feature for this
# may not be operational and should be set to match the specific allowed size
# for such units. Given the dificulty involved in finding this allowed size,
# this setting should not be set by most users. Note that this setting is
# only active on Apple firmware, requires the "NvramProtect" feature and
# that it is disabled when it is set to a value lower than 1024 bytes.
# Additionally, this option is only activated on direct MacOS boots.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not filter NVRAM writes by size)
#
#nvram_variable_limit 2048

# Adds a UGA Protocol to GOP, when absent, to allow RefindPlus graphics
# display when using modern GPUs on units with only EFIBoot capability.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not add UGA to GOP)
#
#pass_uga_through

# RefindPlus defaults to using the Graphic Output Protocol (GOP) for graphics
# output if available and only falls backs on the Universal Graphics Adapter
# (UGA) when this is available and GOP is not. When this setting is active,
# it will instead always use UGA when available and will not consider GOP.
# This may also improve RefindPlus loading speed on legacy UGA-Only GPUs.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not prefer UGA over GOP for graphics)
#
#prefer_uga

# Some computers, such as some classic MacPros, may have multiple GOP instances:
#     - One installed on the Console Out handle
#     - Others installed on GPU handles.
# GOP on the Console Out Handle is what everything uses and is provided by
# the system firmware and others by GPU Option ROMs. The system firmware
# should typically forward calls from the Console Out Handle GOP to the
# others transparently. On such models, it only works in this way with
# GPUs with system firmware support. This option replaces GOP on the
# Console Out Handle with one from a GPU Handle on such models when
# running capable GPUs that are not supported by system firmware.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not provide GOP from GPU)
#
#provide_console_gop

# Some types of firmware, typically supplied by HP, may effectively lock partitions
# as their "DiskIo" protocols are opened "BY_DRIVER", or a "partition driver", but
# no filesystem is generated from the DiskIo. This stops other filesystem drivers
# from connecting to the handles to actually generate filesystems when attempts
# are made to install alternative drivers, making such partitions inaccessible
# or hang in RefindPlus (as firmware supplied drivers may not be compatible).
# When this token is active, RefindPlus disconnects such firmware supplied
# drivers to accommodate otherwise disabled user supplied alternatives.
# NB: This token is always disabled when Apple firmware is detected.
#     This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not handle such partitions)
#
#ransom_drives

# Use a built-in GOP renderer which may provide enhanced performance
# and fix rendering issues on certain specific GPU models including
# the Radeon VII and some versions of the Radeon 5700 XT. However,
# this should only be used when there is an obvious benefit as it
# may result in glitches in the pre-boot configuration screen or
# slow scrolling response on booting into the operating system.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not use the built-in GOP)
#
#renderer_direct_gop

# The SimpleText protocol on the ConsoleOut handle is usually used for
# text output. On Macs and some other firmware, this is complicated by
# the ConsoleControl protocol which determines whether to output text,
# graphics, or both, and this often results in an inability to display
# text, or use tools needing text output (such as EFI Shell). A custom
# text renderer is added on top of GOP by this option as a workaround.
# Note that this option is forced on whenever text output is required,
# such as when running EFI Shell or, whenever RefindPlus is changed to
# text mode as part of its operations (mainly to show error messages).
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not use a custom text renderer)
#
#renderer_text

# RefindPlus will automatically scale icons and text when HiDPI or LoRez screens are detected.
# The detection is basic and based on detecting a minimum 1601px vertical resolution for HiDPI.
# Screens are considered to be LoRez based on detecting a lower than 1025px vertical resolution.
# This setting allows overriding the detection as follows:
#  99    - Never scale UI elements
#   1    - Always scale UI elements up
#   0    - Scale UI elements, or not, based on screen resolution
#  -1    - Always scale UI elements down
#
# Scales UI elements based on screen resolution when commented out
#
#scale_ui 1

# Set the screen's background colour. RefindPlus defaults to using the
# RGB value of the first pixel (top left pixel) in the pixel array of
# the title banner image as set with the "banner" token in this file
# or an Apple LightGrey colour when that token is not set. This can
# be overridden by providing three (3) values, between 0 and 255,
# representing the desired RGB value for the background colour.
#
# Uses the default colour selection process when commented out
#
#screen_rgb 250 150 50

# Set arbitrary boot arguments on MacOS boot. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will change the MacOS boot arguments to the specified string.
# This setting only applies to MacOS and it accounts for arguments injected
# by the "disable_amfi" and "disable_compat_check" settings. Note that this
# will create a MacOS boot argument the first time it is triggered and
# that the boot argument will remain active until it is explicitly
# cleared, even if this setting is subsequently deactivated.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not change boot arguments)
#
#set_boot_args "-v"

# Supply NVME driver. When this token is set, RefindPlus will
# use its 'SupplyNVME' feature to load a built in NvmExpressDxe
# driver to supply support when this is possible but unavailable.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not supply NVMe support)
#
#supply_nvme

# Emulate UEFI 2.x support. The RefindPlus "SupplyUEFI" feature can
# emulate the "CreateEventEx" feature, introduced in UEFI 2.3, when not
# available. It additionally modifies the EFI Revision value to UEFI 2.3.
# This may allow running UEFI 2.x tools and drivers on EFI 1.x units such
# as Legacy Macs as several such tools only require CreateEventEx to work.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore builds.
#
# UEFI 2.x emulation is not provided when commented out
#
#supply_uefi

# RefindPlus defaults to storing the name of the last booted loader in
# the "PreviousBoot" variable in the NVRAM under the RefindPlus GUID. This
# provides a default option to be selected on the main screen when RefindPlus
# is loaded. This can however increase wear and tear on the NVRAM and disabling
# the "use_nvram" token writes variables to the filesystem instead, limiting this.
# On some setups however, such as when the "default_selection" token is set, such
# writes are not required to start with. When the "transient_boot" setting is
# active, RefindPlus will not store the "PreviousBoot" variable anywhere.
#
# Always saves the "PreviousBoot" variable when commented out
#
#transient_boot

# RefindPlus previously simply picked and used the first Unicode Collation Protocol instance
# it finds. This resulted in a lottery where such instances sometimes worked and sometimes
# did not. The proper implementation process however is to first locate every instance
# and select one that supports the English language. This has now been implemented.
# NB: This functionality is only fully available on TianoCore builds.
#
# Does not look for Unicode English support when commented out.

# When scanning volumes for EFI bootloaders, RefindPlus always looks for
# the MacOS and Microsoft Windows bootloaders in their normal locations
# and scans the root directory as well as sub folders under the "EFI"
# folder for more bootloaders (Does not recurse into sub folders).
#
# The "also_scan_dirs" option adds more directories to the scan list and
# directories are specified relative to the volume's root directory. This
# option applies to ALL the volumes that RefindPlus scans UNLESS a volume
# name and a colon are included before the directory name (myvol:/somedir)
# to scan the "somedir" directory only on the filesystem named "myvol". If
# a specified directory does not exist, it is ignored (no error message).
# The "+" symbol denotes appending to the list of scanned directories
# as opposed to overwriting this list.

# Set the CSR values for Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP) and
# Sealed System Volume (SSV) features that define access levels on MacOS.
# Values are hexadecimal numbers that define which specific security features
# are enabled. Below are the codes for what the values mean. Add them up (in hex)
# to set new values. Apple's "csrutil enable" and "csrutil disable" commands usually
# set values of 10 (ON) and 77 (OFF) respectively. Note that 77 is just a default OFF
# setting and that users can go beyond this, to values such as 87F, 97F - up to FFF.
# The "csrutil authenticated-root enable" and "csrutil authenticated-root disable"
# commands, added in MacOS v11.x (Big Sur), set values of 10 (ON) and 87F (OFF)
# respectively, when run along with the "csrutil enable / disable" commands.
#
# As of MacOS v11.x (Big Sur), the previous default setting of "10" (ON)
# may leave Macs not able to receive "Over The Air" (OTA) updates from
# Apple with the reliable setting being enabling SIP/SSV by clearing
# the stored CSR value in the NVRAM. RefindPlus will clear the CSR
# setting when "0" is used in place of "10" for the "OFF" value.
# This setting is also valid on earlier versions of MacOS. It
# is recommended however, to keep the default "OFF" setting
# of "10" in place, and to use the "csr_normalise" token
# instead to better achieve the same end (both values).

# Launch specified loader in graphics mode. RefindPlus defaults to

# While using the NVRAM works with most computers, this can increase wear
# and tear on the motherboard's NVRAM. Under conditions where the NVRAM is
# old and/or worn out, it may then fail and result in an inability to boot.
# Storing variables on disk is a viable alternative and RefindPlus can save
# its variables to a folder on the filesystem instead. This will however not
# work if RefindPlus is on a filesystem that is read-only to the EFI, such as
# HFS+ volumes. In such cases, an attempt to write to the first ESP RefindPlus
# can identify will be made. If the attempt is not successful, the variable will
# not be saved and this fact will be logged if running the debug version. NB: This
# option only applies to RefindPlus variables such as the PreviousBoot, HiddenTags,
# HiddenTools, and HiddenLegacy variables and does not apply to any variables from
# other processes/libraries (These are always written to the motherboard's NVRAM).

# Set the default menu selection. The available arguments match the keyboard
# accelerators available within RefindPlus. Select the default loader using:
#  - A digit between 1 and 9, in which case the Nth loader in the menu
#    will be the default.
#  - A "+" symbol at the start of the string, which refers to the most
#    recently booted loader (Unless overriden by 'transient_boot').
#  - Any substring that corresponds to a portion of the loader's title
#    (usually the OS's name, boot loader's path, or a volume or
#    filesystem title).
# Multiple selectors may be specified by separating them with commas
# and enclosing the list in quotes (The "+" option is only meaningful
# in this context). If the selector(s) has two times in 24-hour format,
# the default will apply only between those times. The times are in the

# another boot loader, to exclude directories holding drivers or to exclude
# directories with non-bootloader utilities from a hardware manufacturer.
# This token takes precedence if a directory is listed both here and in

# Comma-delimited list of strings to treat as if they were numbers for the

# In some cases, particularly on Macs running multiple video cards, this
# option can cause hardware to work when they would not otherwise work.
# On the other hand however, the use of this option when not required
# can make some hardware, typically keyboards and mice, inaccessible.
# Hence, this option should only be used when experiencing problems
# with some hardware devices on non-Apple operating systems. When
# needed, a value of "10.9" usually works, but other values may
# also work. This option has no effect on non-Apple computers.

# By default, RefindPlus relies on the UEFI firmware to detect BIOS-mode boot
# devices. However, this does not always detect all available devices and
# in such cases, this option triggers a forced scan and modification of
# NVRAM variables on each boot. This option has no effect on Macs or
# when no BIOS-mode options have been set via the "scanfor" option.

# Write to systemd UEFI variables (currently only LoaderDevicePartUUID)
# when launching Linux via an EFI stub loader, ELILO, or GRUB. This

# Include a secondary configuration file within this one. This secondary
# file is loaded as if its tokens appeared at the point of the "include"
# option. So, to override a setting in the main file, the secondary file
# must be referenced AFTER the setting to be overridden. NB: A secondary
# configuration file CANNOT "include" tertiary configuration files.
#
# Manual configuration stanzas (see next item) may also be specified within
# separate files and loaded as if their tokens appeared at the point of the
# "include" option. Multiple such manual configuration stanza files can be
# defined in addition to, or instead of, secondary configuration files as
# described above. NB: Included manual configuration stanza files cannot
# "include" tertiary, or other manual configuration stanza, files.
#
# Inactive when commented out (secondary file is not loaded)

#include manual.conf
#include stanza-01.conf
#include stanza-02.conf

# Manual configuration stanzas. Each one begins with a "menuentry"
# keyword followed by a name that will appear in the menu screen
# (use quotes if the name has spaces) and an open curly brace,
# ("{"). Each stanza ends with a close curly brace, ("}").
#
# Common keywords in manual stanzas are:
#  disabled    - use alone or set to "yes" to disable this entry.
#  ostype      - OS type code to determine boot options available by
#                pressing Insert. Valid values are "MacOS", "Linux",
#                "Windows", and "XOM". Case-sensitive.
#  graphics    - set to "on" to enable graphics-mode boot (useful
#                mainly for MacOS) or "off" for text-mode boot.
#                The default setting is auto-detected from the
#                loader filename.
#  volume      - identifies the filesystem from which subsequent files
#                are loaded. The volume can be specified by filesystem
#                label, by partition label, or by partition GUID number
#                (but *NOT* yet by filesystem UUID number).
#  icon        - specifies a custom boot loader icon
#  loader      - identifies the boot loader file
#  initrd      - Specifies an initial RAM disk file
#  options     - sets options to be passed to the boot loader; use
#                quotes if more than one option should be passed or
#                if any options use characters that might be changed
#                by RefindPlus' parsing procedures (=, /, #, or tab).
#  add_options - As "options" above but only applicable when under a
#                "submenuentry" keyword. It adds the options to those
#                set for the main "menuentry" keyword.
#
# Note that you can use either DOS/Windows/EFI-style backslashes (\)
# or Unix-style forward slashes (/) as directory separators. Either
# way, all file references are on the ESP from which RefindPlus was
# launched. The order of tokens above optimises loading RefindPlus.
# Use of quotes around parameters causes them to be interpreted as
# one keyword, and for parsing of special characters (spaces, =, /,
# and #) to be disabled. This is useful mainly with the "options"
# keyword. Use of quotes around parameters that specify filenames is
# permissible, but you must then use backslashes instead of slashes,
# except when you must pass a forward slash to the loader, as when
# passing a root= option to a Linux kernel. RefindPlus will load
# faster if the "icon" line appears before the "loader" line.
# Similarly, the "disabled" line, when used, should be
# immediately after the "menuentry" line.

# Below are several sample boot stanzas (Disabled by default).
# Find one similar to what is required, copy it, remove the
# "disabled" line, and adjust the other entries to suit.

# A sample entry for a Linux 3.13 kernel with EFI boot stub support
# on a partition with a GUID of 904404F8-B481-440C-A1E3-11A5A954E601.
# This entry includes Linux-specific boot options and specification
# of an initial RAM disk. Note uses of Linux-style forward slashes.
# Also note that a leading slash is optional in file specifications.

# Below is a more complex example for Linux, specifically for Arch Linux.
# This example MUST be modified for each specific installation. If nothing
# else, the PARTUUID code must be changed to match the disk in use. As Arch
# Linux does not include version numbers in its kernel and initrd filenames,
# manual boot stanzas may be required when using fallback initrds or multiple
# kernels with Arch Linux. This example is modified from one in the Arch wiki
# page on rEFInd (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rEFInd).

# EFI shells are programs just like boot loaders, and can be
# launched in the same way. A shell can be passed the name of
# a script that it is to run on the "options" line. The script
# could initialise hardware and then launch an OS, or it could
# do something entirely different.

# MacOS is normally detected and run automatically; however,

# The "firmware_bootnum" token takes a HEXADECIMAL value and
# sets that value using the EFI's "BootNext" variable and then
# reboots the computer. This triggers a one-time boot using this
# boot option. This can be used for various purposes but one that
# may be of interest is that some Macs may produce lower-resolution
# displays with HiDPI monitors when booted via RefindPlus compared to
# when booted via the Apple boot manager. Booting with RefindPlus using
# this option may output a higher resolution in such cases. Note that the
# "loader" manual stanza option is not used with this type of configuration.
